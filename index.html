          <h3>About me!</h3>
          <p>I'm a game developer student from The Netherlands, creating small games using Unity! While I’m now learning more about 3D and VR game development, I’ve mostly worked on 2D games up to this point.

While my study mainly focuses on creating games and gameplay, I also like to create my own assets, I share these on Itch every once in a while.</p>
